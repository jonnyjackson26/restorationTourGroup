            <p>Several have asked about the tipping for the bus driver. If you wish to tip this could be done at the end
                of each day. We recommend the amount of $10 per couple on the full tour days.</p>

            <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>If you cancel: Deposit is non-refundable; however, it is transferable to another guest on a new booking,
                traveling on the same tour date. After final payment, the full amount is non-refundable. If you cancel
                and you can find someone to take your spot, we will refund the deposit. If we have a waiting list, we
                will refund your deposit by placing someone in your spot.</p>
            <p>The only way to avoid trip cancellation penalties is to buy trip cancellation insurance. If you are
                interested in the insurance, we can help you purchase it.</p>
