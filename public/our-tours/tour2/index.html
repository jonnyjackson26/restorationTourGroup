                <h3>Day Four - Friday October 11th</h3>
                <p>We have a GREAT day today! We will travel to the Community of Christ chapel in Kirtland where we will
                    be taught by the local Community of Christ pastor Nancy Cervi about their beliefs, and their
                    experiences as being stewards of the Kirtland Temple for nearly 144 years. Next, we will go and
                    learn about Sidney Rigdon in one of his church buildings. On our way to the Johnson Farm we will see
                    the home that Lorenzo Snow was born in and make a quick stop at a cemetery to hear a story about a
                    member who left the church but couldn’t leave the church alone. We will have an in-depth discussion
                    on ‘The Vision’ and the impact that section 76 had on the world. Near the end of the day, we will
                    turn our attention to the temple, and we will learn about the Endowment of power and temple
                    ordinances that occurred in the Kirtland Temple. At the end of our day, we will visit an Amish home
                    and have an incredible home-cooked meal with AMAZING pies! While we visit we will see how the Amish
                    live, and will be able to explore their property.</p>
