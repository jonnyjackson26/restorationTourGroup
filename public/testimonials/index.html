                <p>‘The time we spent with Joe changed our perspective on church history. I had studied church history
                    my entire life and had been to Kirtland a handful of times, but the way that Joe taught, and
                    delivered the stories about the early saints gave me insights I had never considered before. A trip
                    to Kirtland is not complete without learning from Joe.’</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>‘I have only been a member of the church for 3 years. My husband and I decided to use our vacation
                    time to visit historical sites so I could learn more about the church. I was amazed at the spiritual
                    events that happened in Kirtland. I am 26 years old. In my group there were teenagers and people who
                    were in their 70’s. During our tour I looked around and noticed that EVERYONE was on the edge of
                    their seats hanging to every word that was being shared.’</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>‘As a retired institute teacher, I have visited Palmyra, Kirtland, Independence, and Nauvoo every
                    other year for the last 18 years. During my visits, I brought a notebook each time, yet I never felt
                    impressed to open my notebook and take notes. While listening to Brother Jackson I took pages of
                    notes. I have never experienced anything like Brother Jackson before. Spending time with him is a
                    must.’</p>

            <div class="testimonial">
                <p>‘I have been on several trips with ‘Mr. Kirtland’ Karl Anderson before. I booked another trip hoping
                    to have Karl as our guide. When I learned Karl was no longer giving tours, I wondered what our
                    experience would be like. When visiting at the Morley farm It was clear to me that the Lord has
                    placed Joe in Kirtland to help teach visitors the significance of the area. There is no place in our
                    history quite like Kirtland, and there is no one who can interpret Kirtland quite like Joe Jackson.’
